<!-- For my fullstack project, I plan on creating a meetup clone that will be have the basic functionality of the meetup app.

Users will be able to create a username/password to sign in and search for groups based on group tags/info. I am not sure if location will also be factored into the search index at this time.

Users will be able to create their own groups and join groups.

Each group will have a mod/creator, a list of its members, and a list of group events.

Each group event will have a title, description, comments, start time, end time, and list of participants attending.

I will not attempt to include other functionality such as group sponsors, photo albums, archived message board, etc. until the basic functionality is completed. -->
